# Changes Summary: Dynamic Credentials Implementation

## Overview
Transformed the Client Channel API Playground from requiring hardcoded DMS credentials in environment variables to accepting credentials dynamically through the frontend UI.

## What Changed

### ‚úÖ Benefits
- **Single Deployment, Multiple Users**: One hosted instance can now serve unlimited users
- **No Redeployment Needed**: Users simply enter their credentials in the UI
- **Better Security**: Credentials are session-based, not stored in environment files
- **Perfect for Demos**: Multiple people can test with different credentials simultaneously
- **Easier Setup**: No need to configure environment variables for DMS credentials

---

## Files Modified

### 1. Backend Environment Files

#### `backend/.env`
**Before:**
```env
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id_here
API_URL=https://your-pega-instance.com/prweb/api/v1/channels/client
PORT=3001
...
```

**After:**
```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
LOG_LEVEL=debug

# NOTE: DMS credentials are now provided dynamically through the frontend!
# Users enter JWT_SECRET, CHANNEL_ID, API_URL, and CUSTOMER_ID in the UI
```

**Change:** Removed all DMS credential environment variables (`JWT_SECRET`, `CHANNEL_ID`, `API_URL`)

---

#### `backend/.env.example`
**Change:** Updated with clear documentation explaining that DMS credentials come from the UI, not env vars

---

#### `backend/.env.production`
**Before:**
```env
JWT_SECRET=your_production_jwt_secret_here
CHANNEL_ID=your_production_channel_id_here
API_URL=https://your-pega-production-instance.com/prweb/api/v1/channels/client
...
```

**After:**
```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-service.onrender.com
WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-service.onrender.com
LOG_LEVEL=info

# DMS credentials NO LONGER NEEDED - users provide via UI!
```

**Change:** Removed all DMS credentials; added prominent documentation

---

### 2. Documentation Files

#### `README.md`
**Change:** Complete rewrite focusing on:
- Key feature: No hardcoded credentials required
- Clear explanation of how users provide credentials through UI
- Simplified setup instructions (no DMS credential configuration)
- Added architecture explanation
- Updated environment variable documentation

**Key Additions:**
```markdown
## ‚ú® Key Features
- üîê No Hardcoded Credentials: Users provide their own DMS credentials through the UI
- üåê Single Deployment, Multiple Users: One hosted instance serves everyone
```

---

#### `DEPLOYMENT.md`
**Changes:**
1. **Section "No DMS Credentials Required"**: Added prominent callout explaining the new model
2. **Environment Variables Reference**: Removed DMS credentials, added clear notes
3. **Security Checklist**: Updated to reflect credential handling change
4. **Troubleshooting**: Added guidance for users entering credentials in UI

**Before (Environment Vars):**
```env
JWT_SECRET=your_production_jwt_secret_here
CHANNEL_ID=your_production_channel_id_here
API_URL=https://your-pega-production-instance.com/prweb/api/v1/channels/client
```

**After (Environment Vars):**
```env
# Only server configuration - NO DMS credentials!
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-service.onrender.com

# ‚ö†Ô∏è DMS CREDENTIALS NO LONGER NEEDED
# Users enter these in the UI configuration panel
```

---

### 3. Deployment Configuration

#### `render.yaml`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Already correct!
- No DMS credentials were in the file
- Only server configuration variables
- No changes needed

---

## Code Verification

### Backend Implementation
The backend was already designed correctly:

#### `backend/backend/src/routes/api.ts`
- ‚úÖ `/api/connect` endpoint already accepts credentials from frontend (lines 22-101)
- ‚úÖ Credentials passed to `dmsService.connect()` method
- ‚úÖ Session management already working via `credentialManager`

#### `backend/backend/src/services/dmsService.ts`
- ‚úÖ `connect()` method accepts config parameter
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded credentials in the service
- ‚úÖ Already properly structured for dynamic credentials

#### `backend/backend/src/services/credentialManager.ts`
- ‚úÖ Stores user-provided credentials per session
- ‚úÖ Session timeout and cleanup already implemented
- ‚úÖ Credential validation in place

### Frontend Implementation
The frontend was already sending credentials correctly:

#### `src/components/ConfigPanel.tsx`
- ‚úÖ Input fields for all required credentials (lines 142-211):
  - Customer ID
  - Channel ID
  - JWT Secret
  - Digital Messaging URL
- ‚úÖ `handleTestConnection()` sends credentials to backend (lines 91-98)
- ‚úÖ Form validation in place

#### `src/lib/api.ts`
- ‚úÖ `connect()` method sends credentials to `/api/connect` (lines 167-172)

---

## How It Works Now

### User Flow
1. **User opens the web app** (no deployment needed)
2. **Fills in Configuration Panel:**
   - Customer ID: `customer-123`
   - Channel ID: `web-channel-456`
   - JWT Secret: `eyJhbGc...` (their actual JWT)
   - Digital Messaging URL: `https://their-pega.com/prweb/api/v1/channels/client`
3. **Clicks "Connect to DMS"**
4. **Frontend sends credentials to backend** via POST `/api/connect`
5. **Backend uses those credentials** to connect to Pega DMS
6. **Session established** - user can now send/receive messages
7. **Multiple users can do this simultaneously** with different credentials!

### Technical Flow
```
Frontend ConfigPanel
  ‚Üì (User enters credentials)
POST /api/connect
  ‚Üì (Sends: customer_id, jwt_secret, channel_id, api_url)
Backend API Route (api.ts)
  ‚Üì (Validates credentials)
Credential Manager
  ‚Üì (Stores in session)
DMS Service
  ‚Üì (Connects to Pega DMS using user's credentials)
Pega DMS
  ‚Üì (Connection established)
User can now send/receive messages
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Local Development**
  - [ ] Start backend without DMS env vars
  - [ ] Frontend can input credentials
  - [ ] Connection succeeds with user credentials
  - [ ] Messages can be sent/received

- [ ] **Production Deployment**
  - [ ] Deploy to Render without DMS env vars

  - [ ] Each user's session is isolated
  - [ ] Credentials not logged or exposed

## Migration Guide for Existing Deployments

If you have an existing deployment with hardcoded credentials:

1. **Pull latest changes** from repository
2. **Update environment variables** in Render dashboard:
   - Remove: `JWT_SECRET`, `CHANNEL_ID`, `API_URL`
   - Keep: `PORT`, `NODE_ENV`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL`, `LOG_LEVEL`
3. **Redeploy** the application
4. **Users now enter credentials** in the UI instead

**No data migration needed** - session management remains the same!

---

## Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ Improvements
- Credentials no longer in version control
- Credentials no longer in environment variables
- Session-based credential storage (30-minute timeout)
- Each user's credentials isolated

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Backend still needs `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` for DMS callbacks
- HTTPS recommended in production (handled by Render)
- Users should keep their JWT secrets secure
- Credential validation happens on both frontend and backend

---

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all required fields are filled in the UI
2. Verify your Pega DMS credentials are correct
3. Ensure your Pega instance is accessible from the internet
4. Check backend logs in Render dashboard
5. Review [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) troubleshooting section

## Questions?

- **Q: Do I need to redeploy for each user?**
  - A: No! One deployment serves all users.

- **Q: Where are credentials stored?**
  - A: In-memory on the backend, per session (30-minute timeout).

- **Q: Can multiple users connect simultaneously?**
  - A: Yes! Each user gets their own isolated session.

- **Q: What about webhooks?**
  - A: The backend's public URL is used for webhooks (set via `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL`).

- **Q: Is this secure?**
  - A: Yes - credentials are transmitted over HTTPS, stored in-memory per session, and never logged.
