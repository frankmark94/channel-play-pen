# ✅ Dynamic Credentials Update Complete!

## 🎉 What Changed

Your DMS Client Channel API Playground now **accepts user-provided credentials** instead of requiring hardcoded environment variables! This makes it perfect for:

- **Public demos** where multiple people can test with their own Pega credentials
- **Development environments** where different developers use different DMS instances
- **Security** - no secrets stored in environment variables or code

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### Backend Changes
1. **Removed hardcoded credentials** from environment variables
2. **Added credential validation** in API endpoints
3. **Created credential manager** for secure temporary storage
4. **Updated environment files** to remove DMS secrets requirement
5. **Enhanced security logging** (credentials are hashed, not logged in plain text)

### Frontend Updates
1. **UI already supports** user credential input (no changes needed!)
2. **Updated banner** to highlight the new feature
3. **Enhanced validation** feedback for credential format

### Deployment Configuration
1. **Updated render.yaml** - no DMS credentials required
2. **Updated deployment docs** - simplified setup process
3. **Added security documentation** explaining credential handling

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### For Users:
1. **Open the app** (no setup required!)
2. **Enter YOUR credentials** in the Configuration panel:
   - Customer ID: Any identifier you want
   - Channel ID: Your Pega DMS Channel ID
   - JWT Secret: Your Pega DMS JWT Secret
   - Digital Messaging URL: Your Pega DMS API endpoint
3. **Click "Connect to DMS"** to test with your real Pega instance
4. **Send messages** and see real responses from your DMS

### For Developers:
- **No environment variables to set** during deployment
- **No secrets in code** or configuration files
- **Automatic cleanup** of credentials after 30 minutes
- **Memory-only storage** - restart server to clear all sessions

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Session-based**: Credentials stored temporarily per user session
- **Auto-cleanup**: Removed after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Secure logging**: Only hashed values logged, never full secrets
- **Memory-only**: No file or database persistence
- **Format validation**: Basic checks to prevent invalid inputs

## 📋 Updated Deployment

### What You NO LONGER Need:
- ❌ `JWT_SECRET` environment variable
- ❌ `CHANNEL_ID` environment variable  
- ❌ `API_URL` environment variable
- ❌ Setting secrets in Render dashboard

### What Still Works:
- ✅ One-click deployment with render.yaml
- ✅ Automatic builds and deployments
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket features
- ✅ All existing functionality

## 🎯 Perfect For:

### Demos & Testing
- **Trade shows** - visitors can test with their own Pega instances
- **Client presentations** - use real client data safely
- **Developer onboarding** - new team members can test immediately

### Development
- **Multiple environments** - dev, staging, prod credentials
- **Team collaboration** - each developer uses their own instance
- **CI/CD pipelines** - no secrets management needed

### Security
- **No secrets in git** repositories
- **No environment variable management**
- **User-controlled access** to their own DMS instances

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy!

Your app is now ready for deployment with this simplified, more secure approach:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "✨ Add dynamic credential support - no hardcoded secrets needed!"
